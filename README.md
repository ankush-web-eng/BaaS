# SudoDev

## Get rid of SDK's and just focus on development.

### Get rid of using the same code again and again. We have built SDK's for you for you so that you can just focus on developing projects. Just make an API call and let us handle the rest.

If you are an absolute beginner or if you are someone who makes a lot of Full-Stack Projects,
then sudodev is for you. It allows people to perform certain tasks by their application by just making an API call. 

If you wanna try out, get your API_KEY now from [SudoDev](https://sudodev.ankushsingh.tech)
